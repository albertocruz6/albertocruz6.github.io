        <h1>Hello! ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)</h1>
	<p> My name is <strong>Alberto I. Cruz Salamán</strong> and I welcome you to my github page! I'm currently a CSE/EE student in UPRM. I'm <em>working</em> on projects but at the moment I'm focusing in classes. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
	<p> I'll use this page to let other people around see progress on them and to ask questions! </p>
	<p> Most of them are located in github and will be finished soon!</p>

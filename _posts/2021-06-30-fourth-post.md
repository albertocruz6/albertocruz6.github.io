Almost didn't make it in time for this month's update! I've been REALLY busy. Currently I'm at a Microsoft Internship :-). I'm mostly using github in my spare time to work on university projects that will soon will be launched. I'm very excited for the upcoming semester and all the challenges that it will bring. I'll leave it here but next month I promise to go in full detail of what I'm actively doing!

See ya.

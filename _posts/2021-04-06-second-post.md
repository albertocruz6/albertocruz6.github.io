 Hey! It takes a lot of time to study for test and design projects for the several enrolled courses so I'm not super active through here o(Tãƒ˜To)
 
 I'm kinda active on my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/alberto_cruzsal)?? Not really?? I usually post stuff that peaks my interests in regards to programming and new technologies (also university affairs).
 
 Some stuff I've been looking at recently:
  - Raspberry Pi 4/Arduino Controllers
      - I'm working on my first server! Also working on a VPN routing with these devices. I want to test how to make the arduino command the raspberry to adopt certain actions based on signals sent
  -  Boost C++ libraries and... smart pointers 
      - Attempting to educate myself in "good practices" and "industry technology stacks" for C++ devs... boost is so confusing and I'm still hardcoding _new/delete_ pointer sequences... we will see...  
  - Angular(?)/HTML/CSS
      - This page is actually me practicing all of that! Web/App development are not my interests in terms of future proffesional endeavours but it's never bad to know a little bit about everything! 

That's mostly what I'm doing in my free time. For my courses I'm actually using Flask and python to make an app but more details on that later!

See you around! :D

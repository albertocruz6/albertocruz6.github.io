So! It's been a while! I feel bad that I havent really worked on this site a lot or in my side projects :(.
It has been an eventful semester, with many ups and downs (too many of the latter). Online classes are clearly not for me... and the upcoming semester doesnt really promise any substantial changes to the current format.
I've been busy with exams and tests, but I've learned a thing or two in this past month:
- _Rust programming language and Cargo package and project builder_. Honestly I don't see rust taking over C++ but it's truly interesting to see a very fluid language that addresses many of the flaws that the low level languages retain, will work in a project about it!
- _AI/ML!_. I've been working on an investigation that deals with this topic and I'm excited to dwelve into the world of proabilistics and science in the computational field! The RP4 server will be focuesed on asynchronous managing of models generated from frameworks so I'll keep updating my progress!

That's really all for now, but this summer I'll try my best to be in my internship and attempt to work on these external projects as well.

See ya later!
